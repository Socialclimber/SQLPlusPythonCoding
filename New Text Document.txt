Return the result table in any order.
Solution
# Write your MySQL query statement below

Return the result table in any order.
Solution
# Write your MySQL query statement below
Select eu.unique_id, e.name

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT v.customer_id, COUNT(v.visit_id) AS count_no_trans 
from Visits v 
LEFT JOIN Transactions t 
ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id  
WHERE t.amount IS NULL 
GROUP BY v.customer_id; 

9. Write a solution to find all dates' id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

SELECT today.id
FROM Weather yesterday 
CROSS JOIN Weather today

WHERE DATEDIFF(today.recordDate,yesterday.recordDate) = 1
    AND today.temperature > yesterday.temperature

10. There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.

The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.

The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select a1.machine_id, round(avg(a2.timestamp-a1.timestamp), 3) as processing_time 
from Activity a1
join Activity a2 
on a1.machine_id=a2.machine_id and a1.process_id=a2.process_id
and a1.activity_type='start' and a2.activity_type='end'
group by a1.machine_id

11. Write a solution to report the name and bonus amount of each employee with a bonus less than 1000.

Return the result table in any order.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT E.name AS Name, B.bonus As Bonus

LEFT JOIN Bonus B
ON E.empId = B.empId
WHERE B.bonus <1000 OR B.bonus IS NULL;
